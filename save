# The following aliases (save & show) are for saving frequently used directories
# You can save a directory using an abbreviation of your choosing. Eg. save ms
# You can subsequently move to one of the saved directories by using cd with
# the abbreviation you chose. Eg. cd ms  (Note that no '$' is necessary.)
if [ ! -f ~/.dirs ]; then  # if doesn't exist, create it
	touch ~/.dirs

}
source ~/.dirs  # Initialization for the above 'save' facility: source the .sdirs file
shopt -s cdable_vars # set the bash option so that no '$' is required when using the above facility
